## What Standards Should Exist?

- **Career Ladders**: Career ladders that value individual contributors as much as managers.
- **Creating Content**: Guidelines for content that drive home the need for consistency, high quality, and technical accuracy. **Including social media guidelines.**
- **Gathering Feedback**: It might be helpful to implement a system for collecting and analyzing community feedback, making sure it reaches the teams that need it.
- **Planning Events**: Define DevRelâ€™s role in events clearly, we are not events coordinators. What is our role specifically?
- **OKRs, KPIs, Metrics, Oh My!**: What are the key metrics to track DevRel activities effectively and demonstrate ROI to stakeholders?
- **Growing Our Community**: How and what strategies like automation, delegation, and community-led initiatives help scale efforts sustainably?
- **Working Together**: DevRel touches so many parts of a business. Can we establish guidelines for stakeholder management? Which teams should you be close to? What expectations should you set with them? What SLAs should be in place?
- **Using Resources Wisely**: Recommendations could include strategies for prioritizing activities based on strategic goals and available resources.
- **Handling Negative Feedback**: How to establish a constructive approach to managing negative feedback and turning it into learning or teaching opportunities.
- **Product Influence and Feedback Loop**: Could we formalize the process of integrating feedback into the product lifecycle. 
- **Remote and Distributed Teams**: Guidelines for maintaining effective communication and collaboration within remote and distributed teams. Especially since DevRel teams are often on the road.
- **Advocating for Developer Needs**: Outline common strategies and the importance of advocating for the needs of the developer community internally.
- **Community Engagement Strategy**: What does DevRel do that's different from Community Management? Where do our jobs overlap?
