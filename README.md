# Developer Relations Standards

> _This is an evolving document. You might come across sections that are unpolished or incomplete._

This is a collective effort to establish some standards for developer relations.

As the demand for developer relations (devrel) increases, we're navigating through the growing pains of a relatively young field. The role itself lacks a clear definition, there's no established career path, and we don't have decades of history to guide us. To put it simply: we're figuring this out as we go along.

This brings both opportunities and challenges. On the bright side, we have the freedom to innovate and adapt, which is fantastic. However, it also opens the door to misleading practices and misguided incentives, which isn't ideal.

Let's discuss devrel a bit more. Our goal is not to limit anyone's creativity or box people into rigid roles but to foster a shared understanding of the value devrel brings, its impact on businesses and communities, and what it should strive to avoid.
